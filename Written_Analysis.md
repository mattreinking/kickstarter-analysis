# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

Perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### **Purpose**

This project is meant to analyze outcomes based on Kickstarter data. We will be taking a look at how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart was created in Excel using a pivot table to organize the data and creating a line chart as a visual representation. Each dataplot represents the number of theater plays that were either successful, failed, or canceled during each month of the year. Theater plays were much more successful during the months of April to August suggesting plays were more likely to succeed during late spring and all through summer. The overall number of plays having an outcome decreased dramatically during the months of September to December which can be attributed to the season of the year where most people are celebrating the holidays. It would be best to launch a theater play during late spring through summer to increase the chances of having a successful outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This is a line chart created in Excel to visualize the relationship between the goal amount ranges the percentage of successful, failed or canceled plays. The data shows the percentage of plays that were successful decreased as the the goal amount increased. The higher the goal amount, the more difficult it was to reach the intended goal amount. The percentage of plays successful failed to exceed its highest point of about 80% and only ever trended downwards. Plays would have a greater chance of succeeding if the goal amount was smaller because the goal amount is a more realistic and an attainable goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The greatest challenge in this project one could encounter is separating the categories and subcategories in the kickstarter data sheet and creating a pivot table in an example to chart the desired outcomes.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The likelihood of theater plays succeeding on launch date was highest during the months of April to August.
  - The average number of failed outcomes generally stayed consistent the whole year aside from a couple spikes.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - The higher the goal amount, the greater the chance of a failed outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The datasets provided only show a brief overview of the highlighted outcomes but do not tell the full story of why the plays had their outcomes.
  - The charts only displays data based on one subcategory in all of the collected data.
  - The goal amounts charted were too broad leaving the data to be skewed. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
