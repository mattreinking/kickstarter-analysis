# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

Perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### **Purpose**

This project is meant to analyze outcomes based on Kickstarter data. We will be taking a look at how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart was created in Excel using a pivot table to organize the data and creating a line chart as a visual representation. Each dataplot represents the number of theater plays that were either successful, failed, or canceled during each month of the year. Theater plays were much more successful during the months of April to August suggesting plays were more likely to succeed during late spring and all through summer. The overall number of plays having an outcome decreased dramatically during the months of September to December which can be attributed to the season of the year where most people are celebrating the holidays. It would be best to launch a theater play during late spring through summer to increase the chances of having a successful outcome. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
